# SO2_Labs
Operating system exercises solved during classes. 

Quick setup:

Download the kernel sources from http://elf.cs.pub.ro/so2/res/linux-3.13-update-2016-03-06.tar.bz2
Download the modified virtual machine http://elf.cs.pub.ro/so2/res/qemu-vm-update-2016-03-06.tar.bz2

Extract both archives and then create a sym-link in /usr/src/linux-so2 with the path to your 
linux kernel sources.
